# Mapping Cities with Ideal Weather

## Scope: 
Use APIs to identify cities with a close hotel where weather conditions meet prespecified parameters

## Tools: 
Python, Pandas, APIs keys, scipy.stats, matplotlib, OpenWeatherMap API, GeoApify API

This dataframe was refined to include only cities with ideal weather as temperature between 21 and 27 C, wind speed less than 4.5 m/s and no clouds.
For each, the Geoapify API was used to find the first hotel located within 10,000 metres of the city's coordinates (hotel_df).
The hotel name and  country were added to the map and appear if you hover over each city in the map.Â¶

## Source
Starter code for Python was provided by the Rutgers bootcamp.  Real-time data for weather and cities were obtained from the APIs.
